{(task|}

You should complete this datavis project proposal by **Sunday 6th November, 5pm UK time** ensuring you have committed and pushed it to GitHub. Successful submissions by that time will be awarded up to **5 marks** towards your coursework assessment total.

{(questions|}

I wanted to explore the impact (human impact: deaths and injuires) of natural disasters (focus on earthquakes) on both developed and devloping countries for a set time period? (most likely in the last 10 years).

I think it would be interesting to try to understand how geographical location may affect the severity and frequency of earthquakes globally? (looking into location, faults and techtonic plates)

It would also be beneficial to understand what the causes for more deaths or injuries caused by earthquakes between the devloped and developing world by looking into GDP/ economic data?

Are countires with more counter measures to such disasters effectively reducing the human loss/impact?

_A brief sentence or two with links to data sources._

There are several reliable sources to asertain information on earthqauke data. I used Gapfinder to source the data.
Earthquake data link:
https://www.emdat.be/database

There are also several reliable wayd to get ecominc data for countries. I decided to use data from The World Bank on GDP for all countires in the past 20 years

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

I belive that Data Visualisation will greatly benefit my research questions is that the data I will be handling from my sources is very large and unnable to assist a viewer in drawing any meaningful conclusions in it scurrent state.

The visualisation I hope to create will allow me to present the data in a digestible way that will offer clarity into how geographical locaion plays a part in earthquake impact of earthquakes. For example; having data overlayed a world map could prove useful in showing frequency distribution globally and also understanidng the role techtonic plates potentially play.

A visual will also allow me to effectively create comparisons between large numbers of statistics where tables will not. This will particularly come in hand when trying to show differences in impact on developed and develping countires.

Overall the use of visuals to portray the data will help convey/create ideas that are most likely be overlooked when trying to analyse the data from tables at face value and will be a great medium for exploring my chosen questions.
