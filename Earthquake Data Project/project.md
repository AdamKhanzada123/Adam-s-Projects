{(questions|}

- I wanted to explore the impact (human impact: deaths and injuires) of earthquakes on both developed and devloping countries over the last 10 years

- I think it would be interesting to try to understand how geographical location may affect the severity and frequency of earthquakes globally?

- I want to understand how the level of development of a country would effect the ditribution of deaths and injuries caused by earthquakes?

- Can i draw any interesting conclusions based on trends/patterns I find in my visuals and could further research help provide insight into how some of the patterns in my visuals formed?

Country Development Horizontal Juxtaposition Injury Death Ratio Graph.

This visual was planned to highlight the ratio differences of injuries and deaths between developing and devloped countries. This visual was planned with the intention of helping to understand that the development of a country would potentially be correlated to the distribution of deaths and injuries. I would have imagined that further developed countries would see a higher percenatge of injuries compared to deaths and that generally all the bars would be lower. The choice to display the graphs using horizontal juxtaposition was to allow the reader to make well informed comparisons easily. I shall further elaborate on my design choices later in the document. I thought it would be worth mentioning the stuff above as this was a concept visual that I was unable to implement using code. I believe this visual would have supported me and any readers in answering the questions above.

{(insights|}

1.  My first Insight I was able to ascertain through my visualisations, in particular the world map earthquake distribution visual, was that the spread of earthquakes and there sizes are sporadic at a moments glance but have a tendancy to exist in clusters. A region that has been subject to a single earthquake has the tendancy to continue to produce earthquakes in the surrounding areas. This is clearly shown on my visual as we can see that certain countries and regions have been subject to several significant earthquakes in the past 10 years as shown by the clusters of earthquakes in the follwing places/regions: Central America, Peru, Greece/Turkey, Iran/Pakistan/India, Indonesia, Japan.
    In all of these places we can see they consistently suffer from frequent earthqaukes. Something notable about the earthqaukes within these clusters that my visual has allowed me to undertsand is that the earthqaukes in a "cluster region", typically dont vary too much in magnitude. I can see this by the relatively congruous sizes in the circles. The only time this pattern seems to be broken is when a rare earthquake of magnitude exceeding 8.0 is present in the cluster regions. This is the case for Peru, Chile, Indonesia and Japan. Based on these patterns prevalent due to geographical location I can assume that the areas with clusters of earthqaukes rest on techtonic plate boundaries and that the large magnitude earthquakes which are infrequent are caused by the large build up of friction between plates over long periods of time.

2.  My second insight is regarding the correlation between magnitude of earthquakes and the human inpact that they have, and whether this correlation is affected by the development level of a country. My map visual has allowed me to see the distribution of earthquakes between developed and developing countires; however the insight gained towards helping me answer this question has prodominantly come from my second visual. By looking at the second visual and flicking back and frourth between the interactive filters for developed and developing countries I have been able to deduce that generally both developed and develpoing countries have a weak positive correlation between human impact and magnitude of earthquakes. Both versions of the graph show the tendancy for human impact to increase, the more the magnitude of the earthquake. Where the two filters reveal difference in regression is what I find interesting as we can see that for developing coutries, the threshhold magnitude to see any sort of significant rise in human impact is around 5.5, whereas developed countries observe this behaviour at around 6.1-6.3 magnitudes. From these points a line of regression would reveal somewhat steeper and simmilar gradients showing that beyond a certain magnitude, both developed and developing countries struggle to mitigate human impact, this effect simply starts earlier for developing countries. This is evident in the cluster including China, Algeria Afghanistan and Peru for developing countires and the regression line ascent caused by Turkey, Italy and Taiwan for developed countires.  
    This difference in threshhold/starting points for a surge in graph gradients between developed and developing countries can most likely be rationalised by the ability for governments to be better prepared for earthquakes in developed countries due to increases in government spending towards anti-earthqauke measures; however the graph has lead me to believe that after a certain magnitude the human impact prevention initiatives and the development of a country can only mitigate loss upto a certain magnitude. This magnitude is lower for developing countires as they tend to lack resources and adequate governemnt spending to be prepared.

3.  My third insight would be that developed countries are not particulalry better at managing the total human impact caused by significant earthquakes, but that they are able to effectively minimise the ratio of deaths to injuries better than developing countries. The trend I have noticed throughout all my visualisations is that both developed and developing countries vary in their overall ability to minimise the total death and injuries as we have cases on both sides of the development spectrum where several outliers form. Japan in considered a highly developed country, yet when faced with an earthqauke of 7 magnitude, the human impact surpassed that of pakistan, a developing country that was hit by an earthquake of even freater magnitude at 7.7. This is where I relaised that in order to gain meaningful insight that would negate the effect that population would have on my results, I would analyse the ratio of deaths to injuries using my third visual drawing. Based on this concept visual I was able to determine that there was a trend that the average ratio of a developing countries deaths:injuries was around 40:60, whereas developed countires would be around 25:75. This is shown on my third visual with the sample selection of countires above.
    If I was to assume causation for this difference in ratio, it would be that regardless of whether a country is developed or developing, an earthqauke is going to cause a significant total of injuries. Where the ratio between the two differs comes from a developed countries ability to be prepared and ready to mitigate the worst of the effects. Furthermore earthqaukes tend to be followed by tsunamis and countires that have taken into account the after effects of an earthqauke will most likely be able to minimise the ratio of deaths to injuries.

1.  Use of Graphical Layout:
    The arrangement of visual data can be instrumental in trying to produce meaningful visuals that draw readers towards informed conclusions. Throught my designing process I carefully condisered the best ways to arrange my garphics to support the process of comparison. The careful work of Gleichner was of great influence in my designs as he taxonomised the different approaches to graphical layout and helped me to understand the advantages of certain methods. My graphs made use of Gleichner's classifications as I deduced that my visuals would benefit from using superposition and horizontal juxtaposition to be able to help the reader and myself accurately contrast the impact of inidividual variables.
    My geographic world map plot made use of superposition as I chose to display the data of developing and developed countries on a single world map. This choice was delibrate as in order to help answer my study questions I needed to be able to compare locations and magnitudes on a world map. Using a single world map and having all data overlayed allows the viewer to more precisely notice the differences in circle sizes and also realise the incidences of clustering in relation to regions of the world. This was what I was hoping for and I believe the single world map allowed for these comaprisons to be drawn seemlessly.
    Furthermore my second visual also took advtanatge fo soem level of superposition as all data was overlayed on a single scatter plot. I realised after making it that there were lots fo data overlaps caused by this so I decided to allow the user to filter the data for developed and developing countires. Being able to see all the data on a single plot made it so that realisng the distribution of magnitudes and the pounts at which the gradients of the regression of the graph were spiking was easy to notice.
    The third visual concept was different as I wanted to convey a great deal of information, without the visual clutter that superposition would create. This was due to the large number of countires I have in my list. This is why i chose to use horizontal justaposition. It allowed me to convey what I believ is the most important aspect of the data between the two graphs, which was the size differences in the death and injuries bars on average between the two side by side visuals. I thought this was the best way to represent this data as superposition would have been messy and made it harder for readers to interprate the data. The use of juxtaposition made the transition from input data to visual much easier in general. This relates back to ideas presented by Skupin and Fabrinkant who spoke about cognitive plausibility and how a readers ability to undertsand the inputs and how the outputs were formed by humans will foster a greater understanding of the visuals.
2.  Use of Interaction:
    I believe that interaction is a powerful tool which can be used to greatly benefit the understanding of data and suppliment the reader in drawing meaningful conclusions. From early on in my dsign process I decided that I would make use of Schneiderman's mantra for interaction by utilising "Overview, zoom, filter and details on demand". I found this mantra very helpful as it made sure that my visual interactions were purposeful and able to assist in understanding the data.
    I utilised interaction in my Geo plot visual effectively by starting the visual as an overview of the map that gave zommed out perspective. This was helpful in trying to intorduce the distribution of earthqaukes. I then added zoom and rotational features so that the data could be analysed at a more focused level. The world map itslef is too big to look at all at once so the zoom and movement made it so that individual countries or continents could be focused on.
    Furtehrmore the use of tool tips to give specific data about the earthquake was a necesary bit of double encoding in regard to teh circles as size is good to make an initial determination of scale comparisons, but when focusing on individual earthqauke comaprisons, I believe it was benenficial to have the accurate numbers readily available as meantioned in Schneideman's mantra when he say "details on demand".
    Interaction also played a key part in my second visual where I wanted to ease the process of drawing comaprisons between developed and developing countries so I created a filter. This allows the viewer to consider carefully how development has a correlation with magnitude and human impact without creating visual clutter. I also took Satyanrayan's 8 tuple approach into account when designing interaction but found Scniederman's streamlined approach more effective.

3.  Use of Colour:
    Throughout all of my visuals I put careful consideration into the colours I chose to represent variables. Colour is a powerful tool which can have great influence on how data is percieved. When thinking about how I could effectively use colour to create comparisons between developed and developing countries I decided to using red to represent developing countries, and blue for developed. This is a colour scheme I stuck with throughout all my visuals to minimize confusion. My initial designs made use of red and green; however I carefully reconsidered as this is the most common case of colour blindness so it made no sense to alienate a potentailly large proportion of readers. When it came to picking the colour for developing countires I decided to go with red due to its connotations of urgency and emergency. This was supported by the large spread and number of earthquakes that take place in developing countires so on a white background map it would be something you notice and immediately take notes of distribution on. I briefly considered using a dark colour for developing countries as this is usually associated with negativity but I didnt want to perpetuate any potentaiily racial/income based sterotypes.
    The colour blue was chosen for the oppsoing level of development as it would stad out in stark contrast to the red and allow the reader to easily make judgements on distribution.
    I decided not to use any diverging colour scales as most of the data I wished to encode using colour was nominal so having a shift in colours would only serve to confuse readers.
    Most of my decisons regarding colour were motivated by a a quote I read in Maveen Stone's book stating "colour used well will enhance, colour used poorly will muddle and confuse".
