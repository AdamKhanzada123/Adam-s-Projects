# FinalProject Read Me File:
Neural Network based project researching how to predict PGA Tour player performance based on a variety of playing statistics from 2012 to 2018.

I have chosen to predict the number of top 10 placements a player gets in tournaments throughout the year.

The data collected has been credited to the PGA Tour ('https://www.pgatour.com/stats') and all referencing has been completed in the python coding file using Harvard referencing.

All the code is commented in detail and has specific instructions for sections of code that have run requirements or take a long time.

It is worth noting that to run the code, I used a Jupyter Notebook and several imports of various python libraries such as TensorFLow, Keras, Numpy and Pandas.
Imports have been listed at the start of the coding section in the python file.

Furthermore it is also worth mentioning that you may need to change the address of the csv data file in the code document depending on where you choose to run it.
This will make sure that the data is used and imported correctly when you run the code.

I will also link the GitHub repository I used to keep version control of my work:
